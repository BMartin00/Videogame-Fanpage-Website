        <p>DICE released four downloadable content expansions for Battlefield 1; They Shall Not Pass, 
            In the Name of the Tsar, Turning Tides, and Apocalypse.
        </p>
        <h4><b><i><u>They Shall Not Pass</u></i></b></h4>
        <h6><p>In December 2016, DICE announced the first major expansion for Battlefield 1, They Shall Not Pass, 
            which was released on March 14, 2017, with a two-week exclusivity period for Premium holders. 
            It focuses on the new playable faction, the French Army; the expansion features four new maps set in the 
            Battle of Verdun and the Second Battle of the Marne; Fort de Vaux, Soissons, Rupture, and Verdun Heights. 
            They Shall Not Pass adds new weapons and vehicles, the Char 2C behemoth, as well as the new melee-oriented 
            "Trench Raider" elite class. Two additional maps named Nivelle Nights and Prise de Tahure, both set during 
            and after the Nivelle Offensive, are included as part of the expansion and were released in Summer 2017. 
            As of May 5, 2018, "They Shall Not Pass" is free for all players via the Xbox, PC, and PlayStation 
            websites, and remained free until May 15 as part of The Road to Battlefield V.
        </p></h6><hr>

        <h4><b><i><u>In the Name of the Tsar</u></i></b></h4>
        <h6><p>In April 2017, DICE released the first images of the In the Name of the Tsar DLC. This DLC was confirmed 
            during EA Play 2017, where a short amount of footage of it was also shown. In the Name of the Tsar focuses 
            on the Russian Empire during the Great War. The Scout class for the Russian Empire faction features a 
            female soldier representing the Women's Battalion. Four maps in the expansion are set on the Eastern Front; 
            Lupkow Pass, Galicia, Brusilov Keep, and Albion, while two other maps are set in the Russian Civil War between 
            the Russian White Guard and Red Army; Tsaritsyn and Volga River. It also adds 11 new infantry weapons to the 
            game and various new vehicles. In the Name of the Tsar also features a new horseback weapon called the Cavalry 
            Lance. The expansion was released on September 5, 2017, for Premium Pass, with a worldwide release two weeks 
            later. The cover art for this downloadable content expansion features Vendela Lindblom, the Playmate of the 
            Month for the January 2019 issue of Playboy, as a female soldier.
        </p></h6><hr>

        <h4><b><i><u>Turning Tides</u></i></b></h4>
        <h6><p>The Turning Tides DLC is focused on aspects of the naval and amphibious combat during World War I. DICE 
            released the first half of the expansion to Premium Pass holders on December 11, 2017, containing 2 maps 
            set during the Gallipoli Campaign: Achi Baba and Cape Helles. This expansion adds six new infantry weapons 
            to the game, as well as a new "Infiltrator" elite class, which is equipped with a heliograph spawn beacon gadget, 
            signal flare gun, and the Martini-Henry Grenade Launcher. Turning Tides also brings back the Conquest Assault game 
            mode from previous Battlefield installments. The L-Class Destroyer was introduced as a new naval vehicle in the DLC. 
            For the second half of the expansion, released on January 30, 2018, Turning Tides: North Sea brought more locations 
            involving naval warfare from the Great War. Two new maps were added: Heligoland Bight and Zeebrugge, along with the 
            Royal Marines as a new faction to battle the German Army. The North Sea release also introduced the C-Class Airship as 
            a new air vehicle.
        </p></h6><hr>

        <h4><b><i><u>Apocalypse</u></i></b></h4>
        <h6><p>The fourth and final DLC for Battlefield 1, the Apocalypse DLC, is centered around some of the most brutal 
            battles of the Great War. The DLC was released on February 20, 2018, containing five maps, six guns, and a new game 
            mode, among other additions. The three infantry-based maps of Apocalypse reflect three of the bloodiest battles 
            of World War I; Caporetto set in present-day Slovenia, Passchendaele in Belgium, and River Somme in France. 
            The DLC brought no new factions to the game, but introduced a new game mode titled "Air Assault" in the remaining 
            two maps. These two maps, both only plane and zeppelin focused, are named "Razor's Edge" and "London Calling." 
            While both maps feature combat above detailed landscapes (Razor's Edge taking place in the Alps and London Calling 
            occurring over the city of London), neither are based on factual battles. Apocalypse brought new weapons and 
            gadgets to Battlefield 1 as well. In addition, melee weapons were introduced to the game. DICE and the Battlefield 
            team also added a number of other components to the game, including vehicles, gadgets for various infantry classes, 
            and the stationary Livens Projector/Gaswurfminen, located on each of the three infantry-based maps. The DLC also features
            two new air vehicles, the Airco DH.10 Amiens and the Hansa-Brandenburg G.I.
