      Battlefield 1's multiplayer features five pick-up based Elite classes:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
          <li><a href="#FlameTrooperKit"><b>Flame Trooper Kit</b></a> – Players who pick up the Flame Trooper Kit automatically 
            equip a Gas mask, a Wex flamethrower, and three Incendiary grenades. They are also equipped with a trench club.
          </li>
          <li><a href="#SentryKit"><b>Sentry Kit</b></a> – Players who pick up the Sentry Kit gain plate armour and a MG 08/15 
            or Villar Perosa (depending on map), as well one Frag grenade and a trench club. The plate armour includes a 
            helmet which prevents headshots to the player, but leaves them unable to don a gas mask.
          </li>
          <li><a href="#TankHunterKit"><b>Tank Hunter Kit</b></a> – Players who pick up the Tank Hunter Kit equip both a Mauser 
            1918 T-Gewehr, capable of doing massive amounts of damage to vehicles and infantry, and a sawed-off shotgun. 
            They also gain access to a periscope and Geballteladung anti-tank grenades. Furthermore, the player dons a 
            respirator and goggles, granting them a permanent Gas Mask, while being able to aim down their sights without 
            obscured vision. Their armor remains the same as that of a normal soldier.
          </li>
          <li><a href="#TrenchRaiderKit"><b>Trench Raider Kit</b></a> – Players who pick up the Trench Raider Kit wield a 
            Trench Club that kills enemies in one hit, Smoke Grenades, a Medical crate, and a No. 3 Revolver, and three 
            Frag grenades. This kit is exclusive to the They Shall Not Pass expansion.
          </li>
          <li><a href="#InfiltratorKit"><b>Infiltrator Kit</b></a> – Players who pick up this kit receive a Martini-Henry Grenade 
            Launcher, a sawed-off shotgun, a spawn beacon in the form of a heliograph, and a signal flare gun that calls 
            in artillery strikes. The player's helmet is exchanged for a scuba mask,[citation needed] allowing them to swim 
            further underwater than the average soldier, but (as with the Sentry) unable to don a gas mask. This elite class 
            is exclusive to the Turning Tides expansion.
          </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <hr>
  
    <h4 id="FlameTrooperKit"><b><i><u>Flame Trooper Kit</u></i></b></h4>
    <h6><p>The Flame Trooper kit is obtained via a wooden crate found in fixed locations on certain maps, similar 
      to Battle Pickups from Battlefield 4 and Battlefield Hardline.
    </p>      
    <p>The kit is focused on attacking enemy infantry and fortified positions through the use of one of the most 
      notorious weapons of the conflict - the Wex infantry-portable flamethrower. The user is also equipped with 
      3 incendiary grenades, and most importantly, a fire-retardant suit and a permanently equipped gas mask, which 
      completely protects from incendiary and gas granades, significantly reduces damage from explosives and offers 
      sentry-like armor all around the body, reducing received gunfire damage by around 83%, at expense of limiting 
      the wearer's mobility and vision.
    </p>      
    <p>The primary weapon, while deadly at close range, leaves the operator vulnerable to attack from afar. It can 
      also kill the user if it is activated too close to a wall or fired at the user's feet. Players are also 
      vulnerable to takedowns from behind, a successful bayonet charge, and other situations that would normally cause 
      death, such as roadkills and falls.
    </p>
    <p>In the maps that don't have the Behemoth will offer a selection of elite kits—including the Flame Trooper kit—instead.

    <h4 id="SentryKit"><b><i><u>Sentry Kit</u></i></b></h4>
    <h6><p>The Sentry kit is a Elite Kit available in certain multiplayer maps.</p>
    <p>The kit is obtained via a wooden crate found in fixed locations on certain maps, similar to Battle 
      Pickups from Battlefield 4 and Battlefield Hardline.
    </p>
    <p>The primary weapon is either the MG 08/15, a belt-fed, water-cooled machine gun that is capable of 
      sustained fire, allowing the user to effectively kill or suppress any infantry caught in their path, or 
      the Villar Perosa, a twin-SMG arrangement with a low magazine size, compensating through an incredibly 
      high 1800 rounds per minute fire rate. Both these weapons, however, are almost ineffective to kill at long 
      range, making it necessary for Sentries to get close to enemies to kill them.
    </p>
    <p>The Sentry carries the heaviest body armor of all elite classes, providing around 83% damage reduction on 
      the torso, arms, and head, against all firearms, and complete protection from melee weapon hits, though 
      from the front only. The armored faceplate also negates extra damage from headshots. Also, in contradiction 
      to player model, armor does cover legs and back as well, so hits on them do standard, reduced damage. 
      However, the Sentry is not protected against exposure damage (fire, gas, explosives), and can fall victim 
      to a takedown or bayonet charge, unlike the campaign variant. Another tactic involves using k-bullets, as they 
      are not subject to the armor damage reduction.
    </p>      
    <p>As with other elite kits, players will have to stay out of combat for 45 seconds in order for them to start 
      regenerating health and cannot be revived. Sentries can pick up standard infantry kits but will permanently 
      lose the elite kit until another spawns.
    </p>
    <p>In the maps that don't have the Behemoth will offer a selection of elite kits—including one of each Sentry type—instead.

    <h4 id="TankHunterKit"><b><i><u>Tank Hunter Kit</u></i></b></h4>
    <h6><p>The Tank Hunter is an Elite Kit featured in Battlefield 1.</p>      
    <p>The kit is obtained via a wooden crate found in fixed locations on certain maps, similar to Battle Pickups 
      from Battlefield 4 and Battlefield Hardline.
    </p>      
    <p>As the name suggests, the kit is primarily intended to counter enemy armor and other ground vehicles. 
      Equipped with a Tankgewehr M1918, a high-velocity, single-shot rifle, this kit is centered around anti-armor 
      and can critically damage vehicles. The Tank Hunter also carries a Sawed-Off Shotgun, a Trench Periscope, 
      two Anti-Tank Grenades, and a common club.
    </p>
    <p>The Tank Hunter carries light armor, protecting the user from around 65% of small arms fire damage 
      (around half protection as that of the Sentry). The Tank Hunter also wears a set of respirator and goggles, 
      permanently giving him the effects of wearing a Gas Mask without obstructed peripheral vision and not 
      restricting the ability to aim down sights.

    <h4 id="TrenchRaiderKit"><b><i><u>Trench Raider Kit</u></i></b></h4>
    <h6><p>The Trench Raider is an Elite Kit featured in Battlefield 1, introduced in the Battlefield 1: 
      They Shall Not Pass expansion. It is available to in Nivelle Nights next to a gravestone and hut in 
      the centre of the map and under point C in Verdun Heights. The Trench Raider's Raider Club can 
      instantly kill an enemy within striking distance without a long killing animation, allowing for 
      fast and brutal gameplay. Coupled with a faster movement speed and higher durability than most, the 
      Trench Raider also carries a replenishing Medical Crate for healing, replenishing smoke grenades, as 
      well as a No. 3 Revolver and 3 frag grenades as backup weapons.
    </p>
    <p>The Trench Raider is equipped with body armor that provides around 83% damage protection against firearms and front 
      melee weapon hits. The level of protection is that of the Sentry, as with all other elite classes except the 
      Tank Hunter . The Trench Raider is still vulnerable to fire, explosives, bayonet charge and melee takedowns, 
      but can use his gas mask unlike the Sentry.
    </p>
    <p>The Raider Club is able to kill in one hit without a takedown animation. This makes it possible to have the No. 
      3 Revolver in hand and still chain melee kills together, making the Trench Raider more flexible in long distance engagements.
    </p>      
    <p>The Trench Raider also has a permanent speed boost, an ability that makes him around 10% faster than regular 
      infantry soldiers. This allows him to easily catch up with retreating enemies or evacuate quickly 
      when a situation is beyond his power.
    </p>
    <p>The Trench Raider makes a very distinct grunting noise whenever he attacks, even when firing the revolver.
    </p>
    <p>One disadvantage to the trench club, is that you cannot use it against the sentry, and it does little to no damage.

    <h4 id="InfiltratorKit"><b><i><u>Infiltrator Kit</u></i></b></h4>
    <h6><p>The Infiltrator is an Elite Kit featured in Battlefield 1 in the Battlefield 1: Turning Tides expansion. 
      It provides the team with explosive power and increased mobility.
    </p>      
    <p>The kit is provided with a unique weapon—the Martini-Henry Grenade Launcher—and two unique gadgets. 
      The Signal Flare allows the Infiltrator to call down a powerful artillery strike, and the Heliograph 
      temporarily provides teammates with an independent spawn point. The Sawed-Off Shotgun serves as the kit 
      sidearm. Other carried equipment include Smoke Grenades and light armor. The Infiltrator has 
      improved spotting and movement speed.
    </p>
    <p>Despite carrying some powerful weapons, the Infiltrator can be overwhelmed by 
      multiple assailants, and can easily injure himself.
