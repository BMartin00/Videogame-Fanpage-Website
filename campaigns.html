    <h4><b><u>Characters</u></b></h4>
    <p>
        During the single-player campaigns, the player controls six different characters from a first-person perspective 
        over six different chapters (known as War Stories). Unlike previous campaigns in the series, 
        Battlefield 1's single-player story mode is composed of six separate "War Stories", 
        each shown through the eyes of separate Allied soldiers from different nationalities:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#StormOfSteel">"Storm of Steel"</a> – the prologue of the game, set in France 
            through the eyes of several Harlem Hellfighters
        </li>
        <li><a href="#ThroughMudAndBlood">"Through Mud and Blood"</a> – set in France through the 
            eyes of a British tank driver
        </li>
        <li><a href="#FriendsInHighPlaces">"Friends in High Places"</a> – set in France and the UK and seen 
            through the eyes of a Royal Flying Corps fighter pilot
        </li>
        <li><a href="#AvantiSavoia">"Avanti Savoia"</a> – set in Italy and seen through the eyes of 
            a mournful survivor and member of the Arditi   
        </li>
        <li><a href="#TheRunner">"The Runner"</a> – taking place on the Gallipoli Peninsula 
            (part of the Ottoman Empire) through the eyes of an ANZAC runner
        </li>
        <li><a href="#NothingIsWritten">"Nothing is Written"</a> – set in the Kingdom of Hejaz through the 
            eyes of a Bedouin warrior under the command of Lawrence of Arabia
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4><b><u>Plots</u></b></h4>
    <h5 id="StormOfSteel"><b><i>Storm of Steel</i></b></h5>
    <p>The prologue, set in 1918, sees players take control of different members of the Harlem Hellfighters 
      s they defend their positions against a German offensive in France during the Meuse–Argonne offensive. 
      The player initially starts out near the front line and must survive as long as possible against 
      waves of German soldiers. If the player survives the attack, an artillery barrage will rain down on 
      them and then the game's perspective will shift to another soldier. During the course of the gameplay, 
      an unnamed narrator (one of the Hellfighters) gives commentary on the nature of the war as the battle continues 
      and player-controlled soldiers are killed.
    </p>
    <p>At the start of the battle, the Hellfighters initially lose ground to the Germans, but British tanks 
      force the German troops into a retreat until the tanks are stalled by artillery during Hundred Days Offensive. 
      The Hellfighters mount a counteroffensive and push forward, sustaining casualties as the Germans hold their ground. 
      When the player switches perspective to the final soldier in the gameplay, a German soldier attempts to kill 
      the player character with a shovel but is stopped short by an artillery barrage that wipes out all of the 
      combatants on the battlefield and renders the player unconscious. When the player character regains 
      consciousness, he initially appears to be the lone survivor but quickly encounters a German survivor. 
      Although the two-point their weapons at one another, exhaustion and battle fatigue set in as both realize the 
      futility of their situation, inclining both men to lower their weapons. The game then proceeds to an introduction 
      cinematic that opens up to the other War Stories.
    </p>

    <h5 id="ThroughMudAndBlood"><b><i>Through Mud and Blood</i></b></h5>
    <p>Set in the Autumn of 1918 during the Battle of Cambrai in the Hundred Days Offensive, players assume 
      the role of Daniel Edwards, a former chauffeur who enlists in the war as a British tank driver. 
      Edwards is assigned to a Mark V tank dubbed "Black Bess," and meets the rest of his crew: Townsend, 
      the tank crew's commander; McManus, a cynical gunner who doubts Edwards' abilities and the likelihood of 
      the crew's success; Pritchard, another gunner; and Finch, the friendly mechanic.
    </p>
    <p>The crew must penetrate German lines to reach the French town of Cambrai and help capture strategic positions 
      and destroy artillery batteries. Finch is killed by machine-gun fire early on while trying to repair the tank, 
      and later on, the tank becomes trapped in mud and surrounded by German infantry. Townsend decides to summon an 
      artillery strike on their own position with the tank's messenger pigeon to save the tank, which McManus objects 
      to vehemently. Pritchard is shot and killed trying to release the pigeon, forcing Edwards to do so, which 
      enables British artillery to save the tank. Encountering thick fog in the nearby Bourlon Wood, Edwards acts as 
      a forward scout to guide the tank. Clearing the forest, the tank becomes beset with mechanical problems, and 
      Townsend sends Edwards and McManus to salvage spark plugs from British tanks captured by the Germans. McManus 
      expresses his disdain for their orders and abandons the mission, deserting. However, McManus has a change of 
      heart later on and returns just in time to save Edwards from a German soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the tank repaired, the crew proceeds to a railway station defended by German forces. Although Bess is 
      the only British tank in the area, the crew attacks the railway station to deceive the Germans into 
      thinking that a large British offensive is underway. Eliminating the German forces at the railway station, 
      the tank proceeds to Cambrai but is immobilized by artillery and attacked by German soldiers. Edwards and McManus 
      are wounded defending the tank, and an injured Townsend sacrifices himself by igniting a gas leak inside the 
      tank, killing himself and the Germans. With Bess destroyed and Edwards and McManus the only survivors, the two 
      proceed alone on foot to Cambrai. Closing subtitles indicate that with the participation of more than 300 tanks at 
      the Battle of Cambrai, the war ended a month later.</p>
    </p>

    <h5 id="FriendsInHighPlaces"><b><i>Friends in High Places</i></b></h5>
    <p>In this story, set in the Spring of 1917 during the Battle of Arras players control Clyde Blackburn, an 
      American pilot and gambler with a habit of deceitful behavior. Early on, Blackburn cheats George Rackham, a 
      pilot of British nobility, in a game of cards and steals the latter's plane. Posing as Rackham, Blackburn 
      introduces himself to Rackham's gunner, Wilson, and the two set off on an aerial exercise. During the exercise, 
      German aircraft ambush the duo, and the two pilots take photographs of a German munitions base they stumble 
      upon after fighting off the enemy fighters. Although Wilson is reluctant to show the photos to British Command 
      out of fears of being accused of insubordination, Blackburn cajoles him into doing so with the prospect of winning 
      medals. Wilson agrees on the condition that Blackburn returns them both safe from future missions.
    </p>
    <p>Blackburn and Wilson escort British bombers in an assault on the photographed German munitions base. Although the 
      base is destroyed, Blackburn and Wilson are caught in a bomb explosion and crash behind enemy lines, separated. 
      Blackburn sneaks through German positions and discovers Wilson is injured. Knowing that he will be unable to 
      return to British lines safely while carrying Wilson, Blackburn contemplates putting his companion out of his misery 
      but changes his mind when Wilson reveals he knew Blackburn's true identity all along. Blackburn carries Wilson 
      through no-man's land to friendly lines but is detained by British Provosts under the orders of Rackham.
    </p>
    <p>On the way to the court-martial in London, the vessel carrying Blackburn, Rackham, and Wilson is attacked by a 
      German aerial raid, and Rackham is killed. Blackburn and Wilson commandeer a plane and fight off the German raid. 
      Blackburn and Wilson first destroy a wave of German bombers and fighters before crashing into a German Zeppelin and 
      using its anti-aircraft gun to destroy another Zeppelin. The two pilots jump into the River Thames after the Zeppelin 
      plummets to the ground. The story ends with Blackburn climbing out of the river unharmed, reflecting on his experiences. 
      He notes that mixed accounts of his exploits may arise due to the confusing nature of the war, but suggests that 
      his version of events is the truth. The story ends on an ambiguous note by leaving the question open as to whether 
      the events of the story truly occurred as they did.
    </p>

    <h5 id="AvantiSavoia"><b><i>Avanti Savoia!</i></b></h5>
    <p>Taking place during the autumn of 1918 in the Dolomites in Northern Italy during the Italian front, players assume 
      the role of Luca Vincenzo Cocchiola, a member of the Arditi unit. The story is conveyed by an aged Luca years after 
      the war as he recounts his memories to his American daughter on his birthday. He and his twin brother, Matteo, take 
      part in a major offensive to seize an Austro-Hungarian fortress, days after their 21st birthday. While Matteo 
      takes part in the main thrust of the offensive, Luca's unit plays an auxiliary role, eliminating barriers to 
      the main advance forces. Donning heavy body armor and using a MG08/15 Luca spearheads the assault on key Austro-Hungarian 
      positions, capturing strongpoints, destroying an artillery gun, and thwarting an enemy aerial assault.
    </p>
    <p>In desperation to stop the assault on the fort, the Austro-Hungarian bombers trigger a landslide to obstruct the 
      Italian offensive. Desperate to save his brother, Luca sets off alone into the battlefield to find his brother's unit, 
      armed with Villar Perosa and Beretta M1915. Along the way, he assists trapped Italian units and pushes toward the 
      direction of the enemy fort. After clearing the fortress, Luca finds the remains of his brother's unit and stumbles 
      upon his deceased brother; much to his grief and dismay. A mourning Luca in the present-day bids his brother farewell 
      and happy birthday, while a concluding subtitle states that the war affected both nation-states and empires, as well 
      as families, with survivors and the deceased of the war named the "Lost Generation."
    </p>

    <h5 id="TheRunner"><b><i>The Runner</i></b></h5>
    <p>Set during the Gallipoli Campaign of 1915, the player takes on the role of Australian messenger and Second Boer War 
      veteran, Frederick Bishop. The story starts with Bishop encountering young Jack Foster, who says he is Bishop's 
      new charge. While initially cynical, Bishop reluctantly relents and takes Foster under his wing, but warns Foster 
      to refrain from battle due to his inexperience and young age. Bishop storms the beaches of Gallipoli at Cape Helles 
      and captures a strategic enemy position. Bishop fires a flare to signify the capture of the position but is startled 
      by a lone Foster, who disobeyed Bishop's command to only move up with the rest of the Allied forces. Bishop berates 
      Foster for his naivety and view of war as a glorious activity, given that Foster had lied about his age to enlist. 
      Foster becomes appalled at the sight of the carnage around him, but Bishop softens his rhetoric and reassures 
      Foster that they will be alright.
    </p>
    <p>The next day, Bishop volunteers as a runner in place of Foster, whom Bishop considers inexperienced for the task. 
      Bishop returns to HQ to deliver a message and is saved by Foster, who shoots a nearby Ottoman soldier. British 
      officer Whitehall dispatches Bishop to a rear command post to inform them that the British intend to advance further. 
      Bishop finds the rear CP deserted, and discovers that the British intend to retreat and cover the withdrawal with 
      artillery fire. Remembering that Foster is still on the frontlines, Bishop rushes back to retrieve him. Finding 
      Whitehall, Bishop is shocked to discover that Foster has joined an assault on an Ottoman fortress. Bishop decides 
      to pursue Foster, while a distressed Whitehall permits Bishop to disobey the fallback order to get Foster, telling 
      him he has not much time.
    </p>
    <p>Bishop finds Foster and informs him of the imminent artillery strike, but the young Australian says that they cannot 
      abandon their wounded. Bishop attacks the fort to cover the withdrawal, but tells Foster to fire a flare when the 
      retreat is completed so that the former can make his own escape. Bishop then single-handedly captures the fort and 
      is mortally wounded in the process, but sees Foster's flare and is relieved to see that the retreat was successful. 
      The story ends as Bishop dies from his wounds, watching as British warships shell the fort. Closing subtitles state 
      that the Ottomans eventually won the Battle at Gallipoli, and several notable survivors went on to lead a postwar Turkey. 
      Australian and New Zealand troops fought at Gallipoli under their own flags, distinguishing themselves in combat after
      marking the Anzac Day.
    </p>

    <h5 id="NothingIsWritten"><b><i>Nothing is Written</i></b></h5>
    <p>Taking place in the spring of 1918, players assume control of Zara Ghufran, a Bedouin rebel working directly 
      alongside British intelligence officer T. E. Lawrence (better known as Lawrence of Arabia) as they fight to undermine 
      the Ottoman occupation of the Arabian Peninsula. Zara infiltrates a derailed Ottoman train in "Al-Ajdar" and retrieves 
      a manual with Ottoman communication codes. Although caught in a trap by Tilkici, an Ottoman officer, Zara is rescued 
      by Lawrence and several Bedouin insurgents. Zara and Lawrence decide to interrogate Tilkici on how to use the code 
      manually to lure the Canavar, an Ottoman armored train, into a trap, but Tilkici scoffs that the rebels will not triumph.
    </p>
    <p>Having interrogated Tilkici, the rebels discover that they must use message capsules held by three Ottoman officers to 
      ask the train to stand down. Zara proceeds alone, successfully infiltrating Ottoman camps to release two message capsules 
      by a pigeon while eliminating the Ottoman commanders. However, as she prepares to release the third capsule, she is knocked 
      unconscious by Tilkici, who managed to escape from Lawrence. Tilkici drags Zara out into the desert and taunts her, having 
      already ordered the Canavar to strike Lawrence's camp. However, Zara kills Tilkici before he can execute her.
    </p>
    <p>Returning to Lawrence, who survived the attack by relocating following Tilkici's escape, Zara and Lawrence decide 
      to attack the armored train while it stops for supplies. Zara infiltrates the village where the Canavar stops and 
      destroys segments of the train to impede the train's movement. Zara and the rebels destroy the train in an intense 
      battle, ending the threat to their forces. Having achieved her "revenge" against the Canavar, Zara joins Lawrence to 
      strike at targets in the Suez Canal. The closing subtitles indicate that although the Ottomans lost the war, the Allies 
      refused to grant the Arabs full autonomy and that conflicts in the region continue into the 21st century.
