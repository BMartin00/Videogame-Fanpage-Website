        <p>Battlefield 1's multiplayer mode features numerous game types seen in previous entries in the franchise, as well as new modes;
        </p>
        <h4><b><i><u>Conquest</u></i></b></h4>
        <h6><p>Conquest: one of the standard game modes in the Battlefield series. Teams capture objectives across the 
            map, earning points based on the number of objectives they hold. If a team is suffering from a major point 
            deficit, a Behemoth-class vehicle (such as a Zeppelin L 30, an armoured train, a Dreadnought, or a Char 2C) 
            becomes available for their use.
        </p></h6><hr>

        <h4><b><i><u>Domination</u></i></b></h4>
        <h6><p>Domination: a version of Conquest with a smaller map and fewer control points.
        </p></h6><hr>

        <h4><b><i><u>Rush</u></i></b></h4>
        <h6><p>Rush: another standard game mode in the series, played between a defending and attacking team. An 
            attacking team with a limited number of respawns must attempt to plant bombs in two telegraph stations 
            located within a sector of the map, while the defending team must protect the stations and defuse 
            planted bombs before they explode. If the attackers are successful, their respawns are replenished and 
            the defending team falls back to the next sector. The game ends if the defending team exhausts the 
            attackers' respawn tickets, or the attacking team captures the final telegraph stations. Unlike Rush 
            modes in previous Battlefield games, the telegraph stations can also be used to call for artillery 
            fire against the attackers.
        </p></h6><hr>

        <h4><b><i><u>Operations</u></i></b></h4>
        <h6><p>Operations: A new mode which takes place across multiple maps to simulate a campaign 
            from the war. An attacking team controls a battalion with limited respawn tickets; similarly to 
            Rush, they must progress across sectors of a map by capturing their control points. If the attacking 
            team exhausts their tickets, they lose one of their three battalions, and must try again. If the attackers
            are successful, the teams move onto a different map. The attacking team wins if they successfully clear 
            all maps without running out of battalions, while the defenders win if they eliminate all three of their 
            opponents' battalions. The attacking team can be granted a Behemoth vehicle if they lose a battalion. 
            Conversely, if the defending team is losing too rapidly, they will be granted a behemoth to even the odds.
        </p></h6><hr>

        <h4><b><i><u>Team Deathmatch</u></i></b></h4>
        <h6><p>Team Deathmatch: a standard game in which teams compete to reach a target number of kills, or the 
            highest number of kills before time expires.
        </p></h6><hr>

        <h4><b><i><u>War Pigeons</u></i></b></h4>
        <h6><p>War Pigeons: a new, capture the flag-like mode in which two teams must attempt to capture a messenger 
            pigeon used to signal artillery fire. After the pigeon is captured, the player must be defended 
            while they prepare the message to be sent, and the pigeon must be released outside. However, the 
            opposing team can still shoot down the pigeon. The first team to successfully release 3 pigeons wins the game.
        </p></h6><hr>

        <h4><b><i><u>Frontlines</u></i></b></h4>
        <h6><p>Frontlines: A new mode added in the They Shall Not Pass DLC, described as a "tug of war" combining aspects 
            of Operations and Rush. A map contains five control points along a linear path connecting the bases of 
            the two teams. Beginning at the centre of the map, a team must progress towards their opponents' base 
            by capturing each successive control point. If the point is captured by the opposing team instead, they 
            are pushed back towards their own territory. If a team reaches their opponent's base, they must then destroy 
            the two telegraph stations within to win the game. As in Rush, the defending team can use the telegraph 
            stations to call for artillery fire. If the attacking team does not destroy both stations before they run 
            out of tickets, they are pushed out and must capture the final objective again before they can make another attempt.
        </p></h6><hr>

        <h4><b><i><u>Supply Drop</u></i></b></h4>
        <h6><p>Supply Drop: A new mode added in the In the Name of the Tsar DLC. This game mode is inspired by the 
            huge areas the Eastern Front of World War 1 took place on. Teams fight over these supply drops, which 
            give the capturing team all sorts of goodies – ammo, health, vehicles, and pickups for Elite classes. 
            The team that then captures more points, wins. Ammo and health is more commonly found in supply drops, 
            but vehicles and Elite class pickups are made to turn the tide of battle in the attacking team's favour.
        </p></h6><hr>

        <h4><b><i><u>Air Assault</u></i></b></h4>
        <h6><p>The newest multiplayer game mode, added as part of the Apocalypse DLC. This game mode, only available 
            on two maps, features "frantic dogfights" and centers on aerial combat. Each opposing vehicle destroyed 
            gains your team points. On the map "Razor's Edge," only single-seat planes are available, while in 
            "London Calling" a wide variety of planes - and a zeppelin - are at each team's disposal.
        </p></h6><hr>

        <h4><b><i><u>Shock Operations</u></i></b></h4>
        <h6><p>Shock Operations: A new mode added in the 2018 June Patch. Shock Operations are like Operations but 
            instead these are shorter, faster with 40 players per server unlike normal 64 players per server and 
            only play on one map. There are only five available maps in this game mode. These maps are called Giant's 
            Shadow, Prise de Tahure, Lupkow Pass, Zeebrugge and River Somme.
